## .Our Origins

ZeroPoint Security was established in 2009 as SecDev Cyber, born from the groundbreaking research that led to the discovery of **GhostNet**—one of the first documented large-scale cyber espionage networks, which compromised over 1,295 computers across 103 countries and made international headlines.

> This seminal work, conducted by the SecDev Group in partnership with the Citizen Lab, demonstrated the sophisticated techniques required to detect and analyze advanced persistent threats, and laid the foundation for ZeroPoint's approach to cyber defence.

Initially focused on commercializing the tools and methodologies developed during these landmark investigations, SecDev Cyber engineered scalable solutions for malware detection utilizing Domain Name System (DNS) intelligence. The company also pioneered managed attribution platforms to enable secure engagement with adversarial entities—capabilities that remain central to our offerings today.

## .Our Evolution

**2009** — Founded as SecDev Cyber following the GhostNet investigation, establishing our foundation in advanced threat research and detection.

**2017** — Rebranded as ZeroPoint Security, reflecting our evolution into a comprehensive cybersecurity provider. Among our innovations is **Blackwatch**, a global internet censorship monitoring system employed by major broadcasters including the BBC to support operations in high-risk environments such as Syria, China, and Iran.

**Today** — Continuing to evolve our capabilities to meet emerging threats, protecting organizations and vulnerable populations worldwide.

## .Our Mission

Today's threat actors are increasingly sophisticated, and traditional perimeter-focused security solutions cannot adequately protect the mobile workforce, IoT ecosystems, and cloud-based operations that define modern enterprises.

ZeroPoint's mission is to make cyber defence intelligent and effective across the entire active defence lifecycle: **Learn**, **Control**, and **Engage**.
